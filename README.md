27. <strong>Experimental data for Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution</strong> – The data shown in the graph below were obtained during an experimental study of the distribution of speeds from a Maxwell Boltzmann distribution. The data was obtained using a velocity selector and is contained in the file mb.txt. For a detailed description of the experiment, the reader can consult the book Concepts in Thermal Physics by S.Blundell and K. Blundell (Oxford, 2006). The MB distribution is given by:

a. Show that it is not possible to fit this data with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution

with a, b are constants, and that the best fit curve is too broad.

b. Show that this data shown in Figure 13.18 can be fitted successfully using a modified Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of the type:
