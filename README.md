# Solving Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution Problem with Python

**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on solving Question 27 from the book "Mathematical Methods using Python: Applications in Physics and Engineering" by Vasilis Pagonis and Christopher W. Kulp.  The problem involves analyzing experimental data for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of molecular speeds.

**Problem Statement:**

The goal is to demonstrate that the provided experimental data, related to the speed distribution of molecules, cannot be accurately fitted using a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function of the form:

$$ f(v) = a v^2 \exp(-b v^2) $$

where *a* and *b* are constants.  The problem statement also suggests that the best fit curve obtained using this function will be too broad compared to the experimental data.

**Implementation:**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`27.ipynb`) that implements the solution using Python.  Key libraries used include:

*   **NumPy:** For numerical computations and array handling.
*   **Matplotlib:** For plotting and data visualization.
*   **SciPy (optimize.curve\_fit):** For curve fitting to attempt to fit the Maxwell-Boltzmann function to the experimental data.
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and reading the experimental data from the `mb.txt` file (assumed to be provided with the book or problem description).

**Approach:**

The Jupyter Notebook likely includes the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading:** Reading the experimental data from the `mb.txt` file.
2.  **Maxwell-Boltzmann Function Definition:** Defining the function  $f(v) = a v^2 \exp(-b v^2)$ in Python.
3.  **Curve Fitting:** Using `scipy.optimize.curve_fit` to find the best-fit parameters (*a* and *b*) for the Maxwell-Boltzmann function to the experimental data.
4.  **Visualization:** Plotting the experimental data and the best-fit Maxwell-Boltzmann curve on the same graph to visually compare them.
5.  **Analysis and Conclusion:**  Analyzing the plot and the fit results to demonstrate that the Maxwell-Boltzmann function of the given form is not a suitable fit for the experimental data, and that the best-fit curve is indeed too broad.

**Target:**

This project serves as a practical example of applying Python and numerical methods to solve a physics problem from a textbook. It demonstrates how to use curve fitting to analyze experimental data and compare it with a theoretical model.
